               <p class="des1 description">Our city has witnessed many more cultures in its past than most others would even in this globalised present.
               Here we will trace for you the origins and remains of the varied communities that hung their boots and called 
               Calcutta home. Lets check out why Chinese breakfast still rules Tiretta Bazar, where the Parsis are dwindling 
               in numbers with each passing day and how the Armenians gave the city its oldest surviving Christian church while 
               we pass the Anglo-Indians, the Muslims, the Marwaris, the Biharis and many more that made this city a great 
               melting pot of diverse cultures. This is one of our most popular tours and highly recommended to get an idea of 
               the melting pot that Calcutta is.</p>

                <p class="des2 description">The British had sought to build 'the second city of the Empire' right here and it is this 'building' that we'll 
                    show you in the course of our walk through the 'European' areas of what was once the capital of the British Empire 
                    in India. There are major plans on to beautify and restore this heritage site with its rich and varied architectural 
                    styles. One of our most popular walks this serves as the perfect introduction to British Calcutta and gives you a 
                    sneak peek into what went into the making of the Colonial Capital of India. So prepare to whet your appetite for all 
                    things Raj.</p>

                <p class="des3 description">We set out early morning, much before the rules against bicycles kick in, on an exploration of the old city of Calcutta 
                    - through its unique and interesting localities. Comfortable clothing, average biking ability, hugging corners while 
                    riding and listening to directions should give you a great exploration of the old city. Based on the morning's choice we
                     can do: Colonial areas / the Black Town / the Grey Town / Localities By The River / East Calcutta Wetlands or a mix of 
                     everything.</p>

                <p class="des4 description">The city from a Royal-Enfield-rider's perspective. Simply because maneuvering through the old town is easier and faster this 
                    way, and we love these beasts that have been in production in our country every since WWII. Join us on a discovery of the city through the lens 
                    of the riders of the cult bike, Royal Enfield. Do the must see sites of the city with intermittent breaks at various bikers' stops. We pick you 
                    up at 8am and take you to the nearest biker's tea stop.  After some tea and snacks possibly, we head out to see the various sites of the old city 
                    and its Southern extensions. Via the old Howrah Bridge we may head out to the Botanical Gardens to check out one of the world's largest Banyan tree.
                    Return back via the new hanging bridge and head straight to lunch at an interesting Calcutta joint. Drop back to the hotel by 12 noon approximately.
                    Special Instructions Not for the faint-hearted. Although we ride at slow cruise speeds, the Calcutta traffic may get challenging.</p>
